        In case its not obvious, I am not a web developer. I prefer programming or 
        network engineering. I do love learning new things, however; which is exactly
        why I opted to create this website myself. Although it lacks the bells and 
        whistles of a professional undertaking, what I ended up with is more than
        meets the eye. Just like me.

        I enjoy simplifying complex problems. I love automation, modularity, and --most importantly-- 
        documentation.

    <p class="center_p"> 
        Essentially, I love saving time.
