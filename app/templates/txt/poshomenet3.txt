Disaster Recovery:
     In the event that RAYMAN (Proxmox) fails, the entire network will need to 
     be rebuilt. RAYMAN used to run RAID-0, however after experiencing a drive 
     failure I decided to use RAID-5 after rebuilding. RAID-5 should protect 
     against drive failures. However in the event where RAID-5 does not suffice,
     below is instructions for a manual rebuild when only GOLDENEYE backups are 
     available (RAID rebuild wont work).
     
          1. Replace the HDDs in RAYMAN. Configure them for RAID-5.
          2. Use Etcher to create a bootable USB for Proxmox.
          3. Reinstall Proxmox on RAYMAN, check diagrams for networking information.
          4. Add GOLDENEYE as an isci target using the Proxmox GUI.
          5. Log into the Proxmox shell.
          6. mkdir /mnt/iscsi/GOLDENEYE/
          7. mount *GOLDENEYE-iscsi-drive* /mnt/iscsi/GOLDENEYE/
          8. Add directory storage in Proxmox GUI, use /mnt/iscsi/GOLDENEYE/ for 
               target.
          9. Validate backups are available by checking the mounted storage in the
               Proxmox GUI.
          10. crontab -e
          11. @reboot sleep 60 && mount *GOLDENEYE-iscsi-drive* /mnt/iscsi/GOLDENEYE/
          12. Upload ISO files for VM images (stored on PERFECT-DARK).
          13. Create Linux Bridge (vmbr1) in the Proxmox GUI, use a different 
               interface than vmbr0. Check the vm-aware box.
          14. Reboot RAYMAN.
          15. Restore vm-101 (neptune).
          16. Restore any additional VMs.
          17. Create templates if needed.
          18. Create new backup schedule for VMs.
          19. Enable email alerts in the Proxmox shell.
          
          Note that it is possible to backup the host configuration of Proxmox,
          however after attempting it it actually seems faster to just manually
          restore the configurations. If my Proxmox configurations become very
          complex i may reconsider; but for now Ill opt to manually restore 
          configurations.
