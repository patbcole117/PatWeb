When I decided to make this website I wrote down a few words to focus my 
design: simple, punk, striking, retro. In other words, I want people to 
look at my website and think: "This website looks terrible."

I'm not a web developer; I'm better suited as a programmer or network 
admin. I don't want to be a web-developer, and ill never compete with the
personal websites designed by professionals (like my sister). What I want
to do, is simplify complex problems. I love automation, modularity, and 
--most importantly-- documentation. Essentially, I love saving time.
