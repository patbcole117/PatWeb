Title: My Website Project Outline
Author: Patrick Coleman

Introduction
     When designing this website, I knew I would have to keep it simple 
     because I'm not a skilled web developer. In addition, I want it to be 
     memorable and adhere to my tastes; after all, this is MY personal website.

     I've always been a fan of punk/post-punk/avant-garde aesthetics. I have a few 
     skateboards; a few pairs of "hideous" custom Vans shoes; my Spotify is full 
     of punk music; and if I find myself in front of a TV at night, the first channel 
     ill look for is Adult Swim. 

     In a world of web-developers all one-upping each other to make the most 
     spectacular, responsive, flashy website possible; I choose to play to my 
     strengths and go the complete opposite route. 
     
     I basically created a strikingly bland RFC-index for all my projects.
      
Infrastructure/Network
     This website is completely self hosted on my own web server. The only expense
     is the domain name and the electricity. The Ubuntu VM that hosts my server 
     runs behind a virtual pfSense router (neptune) provisioned on my Dell 
     Poweredge R720. This means all traffic to my server must be double NATed.
     
     
     Below is a logical diagram of my web hosting setup:
