SaltyMicro is a suite of micro-services intended to gather, save, predict 
and display data from the popular website https://www.SaltyBet.com. The 
suite is intended to be comprised of 4 programs, although only 3  
are currently in development.

Until this project, I was used to creating singular monolithic programs. 
After reading about containerization and microservice architecture, I 
created this project to explore some new design methods and tools.
