Homenet is my home network. When creating my company, Gyokuro LLC, I didn't
quite know exactly what I wanted to do or where I would end up. Inorder 
to facilitate productivity, it was imperative to create a flexible network.
Networking can be time consuming. I wanted to make sure my home network embodied 
a "set it and forget it" archatecture; one that could contract or expand without 
much effort.
