Homenet is my home network. When creating Gyokuro LLC, I didn't
quite know exactly what I wanted to do or where I would end up. Inorder 
to facilitate productivity, it was imperative that I design Homenet to be 
flexible. Networking can be time consuming. When designing Homenet I wanted
to make sure it embodied a "set it and forget it" archatecture; one that 
could contract or expand without much effort. This meant I had to take careful
consideration when designing my IP-Schema and to configure phisical devices
to utilize automation and virtualization.
