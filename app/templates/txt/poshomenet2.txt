     Physical vs Virtual
          As alluded to prior, Homenet is divided among physical and virtual 
          devices. The virtual portion of my network is much larger than the 
          physical portion. On RAYMAN is a virtual pfSense router that divides 
          my physical network from my virtual one. This means that in order to 
          host web servers on my virtual network, the server must be double 
          NATed (or double port-forwarded) to be able to function correctly.
          
     IP-Schema
          I have put a lot of thought into the IP-Schema of Homenet. I wanted to
          achieve a "set it and forget it" feel. To do this, each network has 
          a significant amount of room to grow and VMs are placed in such a way
          to allow networks to be segmented on the fly, If i determine that a 
          service needs further isolation. Presently the IP-Schema looks as follows:
          
          LAN (physical network):  192.168.0.0/24
          VLAN-8:                  10.8.0.0/24
          VLAN-16:                 10.16.0.0/24
          VLAN-24:                 10.24.0.0/24
          VLAN-32:                 10.32.0.0/24    
          
          IPs assigned to devices placed into VLANS begin at .18; I want to 
          ensure that like-devices are segmented into a potential-VLSM subnet. 
          This configuration allows me, if I so desire, to create a new subnet, 
          VLAN-816 perhaps, at 10.8.0.16/28. the like-devices would run from 
          .18 - .30 and neptune would be placed at 10.8.0.16. This schema allows 
          me to squeeze or expand networks as I please without having to re-key 
          server IPs.              
          
     VLANS
          VLAN-8 (dev-dmz):
               VLAN-8 is the development DMZ. This VLAN is available to host 
               development servers that can be accessible from the outside.
          
          VLAN-16 (dev-internal):
               VLAN-16 is the development internal network. This VLAN is for VMs
               that should not be accessible from the WAN but are accessible by 
               VLAN-8
               
          VLAN-24 (prod-dmz):
               VLAN-24 is the production DMZ. This VLAN hosts servers that are 
               accessible from the outside network.
               
          VLAN-32 (prod-internal):
               VLAN-32 is the production internal network. This VLAN hosts VMs 
               that are not accessible by the WAN but are accessible by VLAN-24.
