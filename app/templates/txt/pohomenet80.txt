<b>Introduction</b>
     Homenet is my home network. When creating my company, Gyokuro LLC, I didn't
     quite know exactly what I wanted to do  or where  I would end  up. In order 
     to facilitate productivity, it was imperative to create a flexible network.
     Networking  can be  time consuming. I  wanted to make  sure my home network
     embodied a "set it  and forget it" architecture; one that could contract or
     expand without much effort.

<b>Physical Devices</b>
     Homenet is  comprised of 5 physical devices. Endpoint devices (3) are named
     after Nintendo-64 games. Networking devices (2) are named after planets (or
     minor-planets).

     Dell Poweredge R720 (RAYMAN):
          RAYMAN  is  my  Dell Poweredge R720. Installed  on RAYMAN  is Proxmox,
          a baremetal hypervisor  for virtualization. RAYMAN has dual Intel Xeon
          E5-2697 v2 CPUs; 128GB of DDR-3 memory operating at 1600MHz; and three
          1TB SAS HDDs  configured  to run  in RAID-5  for a  total  of  2TB  of
          redundant storage.

     Desktop_1 (GOLDENEYE):
          GOLDENEYE  a  desktop I repurposed as  networked storage. Installed on
          GOLDENEYE is FreeNAS for storage management and serving. GOLDENEYE has
          5 1TB SATA HDDs configured in  RAIDZ-2 for a  total  of  almost 3TB of
          redundant networked storage.I use GOLDENEYE as NFS storage in Proxmox.

     Desktop_2 (PERFECT-DARK):
          PERFECT-DARK  is my desktop. Installed on  PERFECT-DARK is Windows 10.
          PERFECT-DARK has an Intel  Core i5-9600K, 16GB of  memory, a  1TB SATA
          SSD, and  a 500GB  M.2 NVMe  SSD.


      Netgear-R6230 Router (venus):
          venus is the gateway device for  my LAN. It also provides WiFi.

      Cisco Catalyst  WS-C2960L-16TS-LL Switch (pluto):
          pluto is a  switch that connects all my physical devices together.

      See Diagram 1 for a visual representation of the physical design.

<b>Networking</b>  
     Physical  vs  Virtual  My home  network takes advantage  of virtualization.
     The  physical section of  the  network is  sandwiched  between two  gateway
     devices: Venus, my Netgear R6230  Router; and  Neptune, a  virtual  pfSense
     firewall/router.  Venus  controls  traffic  coming  into  and  out  of  the
     internet. Neptune controls traffic entering and exiting the virtual network
     Together, neptune  and venus  keep my  physical  environment protected from
     malicious or misconfigured traffic.

      IP-Schema 
           I have  put  a  lot of  thought  into  the  IP-Schema  of Homenet. To
           facilitate a  "set it and forget it" architecture I have incorporated
           a few design axioms:

           1. The 10.0.0.0/8 network has a lot of space; Use it!
           2. Segment networks at obvious  VLSM boundaries.
           3. Address devices  so they  are unlikely to conflict with a network,
              broadcast,  or gateway  address;  even if a  network is  segmented
              again in the future.

          Adhering to the first and second axioms, I designed following schema:

          LAN (physical network):  192.168.117.0/24
          VLAN-4:                  10.4.0.0/24
          VLAN-8:                  10.8.0.0/24
          VLAN-16:                 10.16.0.0/24
          VLAN-20:                 10.20.0.0/24
          VLAN-24:                 10.24.0.0/24
          VLAN-32:                 10.32.0.0/24

          Axiom three  takes form  when keying IP  addresses on  devices. Within
          each VLAN,  addresses assigned to  endpoint devices always start  at 2
          above the  broadcast for a  /28 network: .2,  .18, .34 ...  .242. This
          makes it possible  to split vlans without having to  re-key server IPs
          which keeps DNS  functioning smoothly. I would like to  credit Gary A.
          Donahue, the author of Network Warrior, for this tip.

      VLANS 
          VLAN-4 (net-services):  
               VLAN-4 is for network services. Presently it only  contains a DNS
               and DHCP server. In the future I plan to add a RADIUS and  syslog
               server.

          VLAN-8 (dev-dmz):
               VLAN-8 is  the development  DMZ. This  VLAN  is available to host
               development servers  that can be accessible from the outside.

          VLAN-16 (dev-internal):
               VLAN-16 is the development internal network. This VLAN is for VMs
               that should  not be accessible from the WAN but are accessible by
               VLAN-8.
               
          VLAN-20 (fun)
               VLAN-20 is for servers that serve a purpose other  than  utility.
               If I were to have a Minecraft server it would go here.  

          VLAN-24 (prod-dmz):
               VLAN-24 is  the production DMZ. This  VLAN hosts servers that are
               accessible from the outside network and intended to be kept  in a
               stable state. 

          VLAN-32 (prod-internal):
               VLAN-32 is the production  internal network. This  VLAN hosts VMs
               that are not accessible by the WAN but are accessible by VLAN-24.

      See Diagram 2 for a visual representation of the logical design.

<b>Proxmox Disaster Recovery</b>
     Since RAYMAN uses RAID-5, a single disk failure will not require a rebuild.
     However,  if multiple  disks  fail  or RAYMAN  catches on  fire  it may  be
     necessary  to rebuild  the Proxmox  installation from  scratch. Below  is a
     guide on how to do so.

          1. Configure RAYMAN's  HDDs for  RAID-5. 
          2. Use Etcher  or Rufus  to create a bootable USB for Proxmox ISO. 
          3. Reinstall Proxmox on RAYMAN, consult diagrams for networking. 
          4. Add GOLDENEYE as NFS storage using the Proxmox  GUI. 
          5. Upload ISOs to Proxmox. 
          6. Create a new Linux bridge  (vmbr1) in  Proxmox. Be sure to  use a
             different interface than vmbr0 and to check the "vlan-aware" box. 
          7. Reboot  RAYMAN.
          8. Restore vm-100 (neptune) from NFS backup storage.
          9. Import pfSense-configuration.xml to neptune.
          10. Any VM can now be restored as needed. 
          11. Create new backup schedule for VMs.
          12. Enable email alerts in the Proxmox shell.

      This process takes around 30 minutes.
